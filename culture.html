                        <h1>Culture in Lisbon</h1>
                        <p>
                            Portuguese culture is based on a past that dates from prehistoric times into the eras of the Roman and Moorish invasions. All have left their traces in a rich legacy of archaeological remains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the centuries, Portugal's arts have been enriched by foreign influences, including Flemish, French and Italian. The voyages of the Portuguese discoverers opened the country to Oriental influences and the shipping home of Brazil's wealth of gold and jewels fed the Baroque flame of decoration. Throughout the city you will find museums, gardens, monuments and an assortment of events where local and historical culture comes to life.

                           It has never been easy to describe this city's culture so we decided to focus on some of the areas that make Lisbon unique:

                        <p>
                            The wonderful glazed tiles were brought to Europe by people coming from the North of Africa. "Azulejo" (tile in Portuguese) comes from the Arab word "azzelij" and was used when referring to a small, flat and polished stone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Lisbon, the tiles tell us much about the city's turbulent past. At the SÃ£o Vicente de Fora Monastery, you can enjoy a magnificent panel that depicts the conquest of Lisbon: Christians scaling walls defended by the Moslems, flags with crescent moons hoisted up, dead bodies, swords and arrows are just some of the scenes depicted
                        </p>

                            Want to know more?... Find out for yourself! Search for the wonderful glazed tiles at museums, belvederes, metro stations, Lisbon's Oceanarium, viewpoints, churches and Palaces and see how Lisbon was before the 1755 earthquake, how tiles were used to express the prosperity of manor-houses and churches and how a 115 metres long water channel can be breathtakingly beautiful (Queluz Palace).
